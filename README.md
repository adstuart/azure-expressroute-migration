# Introduction

Many customers on Azure leverage ExpressRoute for reliable hybrid connectivity. Sometimes these same customers may need to implement a new ExpressRoute circuit, and have a desire to decommission their old circuit. Common drivers for this requirement include:

- Mergers and acquisitions resulting on consolidation of network providers
- A change of ExpressRoute provider
- Downgrading an ER circuit bandwidth requires a new circuit https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs#can-i-change-the-bandwidth-of-an-expressroute-circuit
- Upgrading an ER circuit can sometimes require a new circuit, depending if the existing underlying port has capacity to support the bandwidth increase https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs#can-i-change-the-bandwidth-of-an-expressroute-circuit

This guides suggest an approach to this migration process that focuses on seamless failover, de-risking rollback, and understanding the correct ordering of steps. Each step will require you to leverage existing knowledge of ExpressRoute, and also links will be provided to go in to more technical detail using Azure documentation. 

# Context

When having any ExpressRoute discussion its beneficial to agree on terms. This is best visualized in layers, highlighting the different components in any ExpressRoute design; 

- Gateway
- Connection
- Circuit
- Partner
- Customer

# Capture existing configuration

Before removing the old connectivity, we should capture its logical configuration and form a baseline diagram to iterate from. Important information shown in the example diagram below includes;

- Which Azure regions are being used, E.g. West Europe
- ExpressRoute Gateway SKU, e.g. "high", or "ERGw1Az" https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways#gwsku
- ExpressRoute connection objects (the things that link a _gateway_ to a _circuit_ within the same subscriptions)
- ExpressRoute authorisations (the things that link a _gateway_ to a _circuit_ within a different subscription) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm#circuit-owner-operations
- ExpressRoute circuit attributes
  - Peering location, e.g. London1
  - Bandwidth, e.g. 1Gbps
  - Provider, e.g. Equinix
  - SKU, e.g. Standard/Premium/Local
  - Billing Model, e.g. Unlimited/Metered
- ExpressRoute circuit peering types
  - Private peering *(the majority of customers will only be using this peering type)*
  - Public Peering (now deprecated, but may still be in use in your network)
    - Public Peering utilises Microsoft managed SNAT ranges. You will need to raise a support ticket to find out your SNAT address. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-nat#nat-requirements-for-azure-public-peering
  - Microsoft Peering
    - Microsoft peering utilises customer managed SNAT, you or your provider will have this information. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-nat#nat-requirements-for-microsoft-peering
    - Route filters associated with Microsoft peering https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/how-to-routefilter-portal
- BGP AS numbers and /30 peer IP addresses for all peerings https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-routing

Once this is complete, you should be able to produce some diagrams like the following examples, I have split out the Private Peering and the Public Peering in to separate diagrams for clarity. The remainder of the document will follow this structure, as these peering types have marked different considerations.

# Private Peering Migration

## Create new ExpressRoute circuit

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager

Follow the above guide to create the new circuit with your requirement parameters. This includes working with your provider to turn-up the new circuit and configure the BGP peerings to your network. The /30 BGP links will utilise new, unique IP addressing.

## Create test Virtual Network and link to circuit

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm

Create a new Virtual Network with some test IP address space that does not overlap with either your current On-Premises address space, or your existing Azure VNet(s) address space. Deploy a Virtual Machine for testing. The purposes of this step is to prove out end-to-end connectivity across the new circuit, prior to using it within your production environment. If done correctly, your On-Premises network can now route traffic to this new test VNet, and vice versa. Carry out your required commissioning tests, latency, throughput etc

> Take this opportunity to become familiar with all the rich ExpressRoute information that is available from the CLI. For example, a good idea at this step is to verify you are advertising all the required routes from On-Premises with the expected AS-PATH manipulation, if any. A great guide to get started https://blog.cloudtrooper.net/2021/07/12/cli-based-analysis-of-an-expressroute-private-peering/

## Pre-provision circuit authorizations

If you are using circuit authorizations for cross-subscription gateway attachment (you checked that already right? ;) ) Then you are able to deploy these ahead of time on the new circuit. Generate the new authorsations and they will remain in the "available" state until redeemed at the gateway level. One less job to do during the migration window itself.

## Configure BGP routing to favour existing circuit

Before we attach our new circuit to the production ExpressRoute Gateway, we want to ensure that traffic only fails over to this circuit when _we_ decide, and not unexpectedly due to routing logic we may not understand. We want to do this to ensure that traffic to and from Azure remains symmetrical, this is especially important if On-Premises Firewalls are in use.

- To control traffic from **Azure to On-Premises** the most straight forward method is to change the Weight parameter, configured at the Connection object level. The default is 0, a higher weight wins, therefore lets set our existing connection to 100.

![](images/2021-08-04-22-30-44.png)

- To control traffic from **On-Premises to Azure** the most straight forward method is to use BGP as-path-prepend. For now, we can leave this at the default on the existing circuit (The default is assumed to be not using as-path-prepend), but we will need this later for the migration, so configure a route-map on your on-premises router than can be used later.

More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-optimize-routing

## Configure BGP as-path-prepend on new circuit

Now that we understand, and are in control of, the routing behaviour on the existing circuit, we can attach the new circuit to operate in a standby state. Part of this will be to use as-path-prepend when advertising in routes to Azure on the new circuit.

Complete this configuration on your edge device/router, and verify the received routes on the MSEE. You can do this using the CLI (see earlier section) or from within the Azure Portal. 

![](images/2021-08-04-22-41-33.png)

Here is an example of a circuit that is receiving as-path-prepended routes from an On-Premises router.

> Note! At this stage the circuit is still not connected to your ExpressRoute Gateway, but you have verified the route advertisements and attributes. 


## Connect new circuit to existing ExpressRoute Gateway



- 
- Create a new connection object that links your new circuit to your ER Gateway, ensure the Weight is set to 0. 
- Verify 

Plan for 10-30 minutes change window.

If you have multiple existing ER circuits

### Less downtime but complex

This approach favours logical routing manipulation routing by allowing only one circuit to be active at any one time, ensuring that traffic flow in/out of Azure remains symmetrical. 

- Delete the connection objects that links your old circuit to your ER Gateways

Despite this document not proposing an entirely elegant solution, I do hope it helps you approach the topic and understand the current options and constraints.
